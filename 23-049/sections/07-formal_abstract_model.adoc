== Temporal Abstract Formal Conceptual Model

The Temporal Abstract Conceptual Model has been built using a UML model. This provides formalization of the astract concepts which can be evaluated against other related ISO and OGC standards. 

=== Context

When OGC standards involve time, they generally refer to the ISO documents such as <<iso19108,ISO 19108>>, <<iso19111,ISO 19111>>, <<iso8601,ISO 8601>>, and their freely available OGC equivalents, such as Abstract Specification Topic 2 Referencing by Coordinates (equivalent to <<iso19111,ISO 19111>).

When dealing with temporal reference systems, it is necessary to understand all of these standards and how they interact. ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC211) provides a useful tool for integrating their standards. The https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG[ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Model Management Group] provides a single integrated model for most of the ISO/TC 211 standards. That model will provide the foundation for the Abstract Temporal Reference Model.

The Abstract Temporal Reference Model is a "Conceptual" model. It both defines concepts and the associations between those concepts. This "conceptual" model is an extension of a higher level "Semantic" model.

=== OWL Ontology

The W3C Time Ontology (<<W3COWLTime>>) is illustrated below.

=== Abstract Temporal Model

The Abstract Temporal Model divides the world into Spatial, Temporal, and SpatialTemporal Reference Systems.

=== Temporal Reference Systems

The Temporal Reference System is further divided into Temporal Coordinate Reference Systems and Temporal Ordinal Reference Systems.

The Temporal Coordinate Reference Systems provide a link to ISO 19111 - Geographic information - Referencing by coordinates.

=== Temporal Transformations

ISO 19111 provides a model for coordinate transformations which can be re-used for temporal coordinate reference systems.

Some Observations:

. Many temporal reference systems are not coordinate reference systems

. There is no temporal equivalent to the Compound Reference System

. DateTime should be represented as a compound reference system consisting of a TM_Calendar and TM_Clock reference system.

. TM_Calendar could be a type of TM_OrdinalReferenceSystem.

. TM_Clock should not be defined in terms of a "day". Many clocks count elapsed time since an epoch. Date and time are not considered.

. TM_Clock should be a type of TM_CoordinateSystem

. TM_Calendar can be defined as a Compound Reference System composed of days, months, and years. This would allow to define meaningful calendars for the Moon, Mars, and other non-Terrestrial environments.

. Is there an ordinal equivalent to TM_Clock. Sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight?

. Can a calendar be defined in terms of planting season, Saints days, or other arbitrary events?

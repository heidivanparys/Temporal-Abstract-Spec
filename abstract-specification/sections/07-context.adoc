== Abstract Temporal Reference Model

=== Context

When OGC standards involve time, they generally refer to the ISO documents such
as <<ISO_19108>>, <<ISO_19111>>, <<ISO_8601>>, and their freely available OGC
equivalents, such as Abstract Specification Topic 2 Referencing by Coordinates
(equivalent to <<ISO_19111>).

When dealing with temporal reference systems, it is necessary to understand all
of these standards and how they interact. ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC
211) provides a useful tool for integrating their standards. The
https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG[ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Model Management Group]
provides a single integrated model for most of the ISO/TC 211 standards. That
model will provide the foundation for the Abstract Temporal Reference Model.

The Abstract Temporal Reference Model is a "Conceptual" model. It both defines concepts and the associations between those concepts. This "conceptual" model is an extension of a higher level "Semantic" model.

The W3C Time Ontology (<<W3COWLTime>>) is illustrated below.

The Abstract Temporal Model divides the world into Spatial, Temporal, and SpatialTemporal Reference Systems.

The Temporal Reference System is further divided into Temporal Coordinate Reference Systems and Temporal Ordinal Reference Systems.

The Temporal Coordinate Reference Systems provide a link to ISO 19111 - Geographic information - Referencing by coordinates.

ISO 19111 provides a model for coordinate transformations which can be re-used for temporal coordinate reference systems.

Some Observations:

. Many temporal reference systems are not coordinate reference systems

. There is no temporal equivalent to the Compound Reference System

. DateTime should be represented as a compound reference system consisting of a TM_Calendar and TM_Clock reference system.

. TM_Calendar could be a type of TM_OrdinalReferenceSystem.

. TM_Clock should not be defined in terms of a "day". Many clocks count elapsed time since an epoch. Date and time are not considered.

. TM_Clock should be a type of TM_CoordinateSystem

. TM_Calendar can be defined as a Compound Reference System composed of days, months, and years. This would allow to define meaningful calendars for the Moon, Mars, and other non-Terrestrial environments.

. Is there an ordinal equivalent to TM_Clock. Sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight?

. Can a calendar be defined in terms of planting season, Saints days, or other arbitrary events?
